## r&d

### creation

* crosswords typically start with a theme
* words and thematic words are the center piece of the puzzle
* mostly just trial and error

### sizing

* standard sizes (depending on day)
	* 15 * 15
	* 17 * 17
	* 23 * 23
* weekends prefer larger grids 

### words and theories

* _never_ create two letter words
* **limit** 3 letter words

### clues

* clues aren't necessarily reused, sometimes just made on spot
